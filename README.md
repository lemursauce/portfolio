# My Portfolio

This is the source code to my portfolio.

This was made using react and deployed using gh-pages.

Directions to using react are left in the `README.old.md` file.

## Current Issues

### Optimizing
* On mobile devices, this website can run terribly slow. Need to come up with a good workaround for such platforms.
  - similar issues for older devices, but it is more noticeable (and more important) on mobile devices

### Content
* Need to better formalize content?
  - could be as simple as rewording or could add entirely new sections

## Plans / ideas

* Work on and add more projects/skills
* Integrate a (working) github action to automatically deploy website
* Set up testing
* ...
* Migrate to typescript?
* Set up blog? (same or different repo pending, naturally)
